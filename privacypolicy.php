        </li>

        <ul style="list-style: square">
            <li>
                The rental company will collect personal information such as name,
                address, driver's license details, and contact information for
                identification and verification purposes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Payment information like credit card details will be collected
                securely for payment processing.
            </li>
            <li>
                Depending on the rental system, data like rental history, preferred
                vehicle types, and past locations may be collected to personalize
                future experiences (with user consent).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <li>
            <h3><i>Data Usage and Disclosure:</i></h3>
        </li>

        <ul style="list-style: square">
            <li>
                The collected data will be used for processing rentals, managing
                accounts, and providing customer service.
            </li>
            <li>
                The rental company will implement security measures to protect user
                data from unauthorized access or disclosure.
            </li>
            <li>
                User data may be shared with third-party service providers involved in
                the rental process (e.g., payment processors, insurance companies).
                This will be done with user consent or as required by law.
            </li>
            <li>
                The policy should clarify how long data is retained and under what
                circumstances it might be disclosed to legal authorities.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <li>
            <h3><i>Transparency and User Control:</i></h3>
        </li>

        <ul style="list-style: square">
            <li>
                The privacy policy should be easily accessible and written in clear,
                understandable language.
            </li>
            <li>
                Users should be informed about the types of data collected, how it's
                used, and with whom it's shared.
            </li>
            <li>
                Users should have the option to access, update, or delete their
                personal information upon request.
            </li>
            <li>
                The policy should address how users can opt-out of receiving marketing
                communications.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <li>
            <h3><i>Vehicle Tracking and Telematics:</i></h3>
        </li>

        <ul style="list-style: square">
            <li>
                If the rental vehicle is equipped with GPS or location tracking, the
                policy should clearly explain how this data is used.
            </li>
            <li>
                This could include tracking mileage for billing purposes, locating
                stolen vehicles, or providing roadside assistance.
            </li>
            <li>
                Users should have the ability to opt-out of non-essential location
                tracking features.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <li>
            <h3><i>Compliance:</i></h3>
        </li>

        <ul style="list-style: square">
            <li>
                The privacy policy should comply with all relevant data privacy
                regulations, such as GDPR (Europe) or CCPA (California).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <li>
            <h3><i>Additional Considerations:</i></h3>
        </li>

        <ul style="list-style: square">
            <li>
                The policy should address how data breaches will be handled and
                communicated to users.
            </li>
            <li>
                The policy should be regularly reviewed and updated to reflect any
                changes in data collection practices or regulations.
